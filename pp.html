    <p>"I would like to thank God for blessing me with the opportunity everyday to play the sport I love and for guiding me throughout my journey,"Paris said in the post. "I'd also like to thank my family as well as my teammates for their support day in and day out."

        "After talking with my family, I have decided that I will be entering my name into the transfer portal,‚Äù Paris posted. "I will always cherish my memories made in Chapel Hill and can't wait to begin this ew chapter in my life."</p>

        According to sources, Paris was cleared medically a few weeks ago but never was in uniform for a game. She did'nt practice with the team, although she warmed up with the Tar Heels some in Columbia, S.C., last weekend and practiced separately.
        With at least two freshmen coming in, that leaves Carolina with three roster spots (see list below) if all of this season's other underclassmen return, as well as graduate guard Lexi Donarski.
